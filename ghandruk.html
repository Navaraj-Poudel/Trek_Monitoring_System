    Trip Overview of Ghandruk Village Trek
</h3>
<p>
  Ghandruk Trek is an ideal short and easy trekking in Nepal holiday at popular Annapurna region for family trekking with kids and elderly. This trek offers spectacular views of the Annapurna Himalayas with a deep insight into local Gurung cultures and traditions. As well, various flora and fauna can also be spotted along the trail. This trek is often considered homestay trekking or cultural trekking since most of the trekkers appreciated such treks in Ghandruk. However, this trek is completely customizable according to the requirements of tourists.
  <br> <br>
  Ghandruk Trek initiates the next day as you arrive at Kathmandu Valley and drive towards Naudanda via Pokhara. And next day short drive to Nayapul from where we will be starting our trekking towards the beautiful and culturally rich authentic Gurung village of Ghandruk. Ghandruk offers fabulous views of the Annapurna Himalayan Ranges, especially during sunrise and sunsets. Another notable thing about this trek is that the village stills holds the charm of authenticity. The houses built of stone and muds give a feeling of real raw traveling. Then we trek along with another beautiful village of Landruk passing through popular viewpoints of Tolka and Dhampus. At Dhampus, we visit go for more spectacular views and villages. Finally, we descend towards Phedi and drive back to Kathmandu.
