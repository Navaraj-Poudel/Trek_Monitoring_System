    Trip Overview of Lamtang Trek
</h3>
<p>
  Langtang valley, located 61.8 km away from Kathmandu, amazes travelers with its mountain streams and stunning views. Mount Langtang Lirung (7246m) surrounds the rhododendron and pine forests that beautifies the valley. The warm hospitality and vibrant culture in the Langtang valley makes you feel like you are at home.
  <br> <br>
  The Langtang trek starts from Syabrubesi (1460m) and reaches the highest point at Kang Jing Gompa at an altitude of 3900m. You can also opt to trek Kang Jing Ri, a day from Kang Jing Gompa, to see the mesmerizing 360-degree views of the Himalayas. The trek offers a route that ascends and descends at several places with spectacular views of landscapes, painted chortens, Buddhist prayers flags and much more. <br><br>
  During the trek, you can see the remains of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. And see how the locals have restored back the trekking trails and the Langtang valley. This village is where you will see the live example of the rebuilding of the nation after the biggest tragedy.
  Langtang Valley Trek offers a majestic view of mountains with panaromic landscapes. It is among the third most visited trekking destinations in Nepal alongside Everest Base Camp Trek and Annapurna Base Camp Trek.
  
  
  
  Basically, this trek is exciting with picturesque views of the beautiful village that lies within the Langtang National Park. Langtang is the best vacation spot for regular and novice trekkers, and I am sure it will be your unforgettable lifetime experience.

As a condition of booking you must accept these risks and be responsible for your own actions and involvement. Adventure travel requires an open and flexible attitude. You may experience extreme conditions, unpredictable weather and last minute changes to the itinerary beyond our control. The ability to work in team is an important aspect of all of our trips.
